# ðŸ¤– Bill Collector ðŸ¤–

## What is it?

An automation to collect bills automatically **without giving away any access credentials**.

Multiple providers, such as `DigitalOcean` do not offer an easy way to retrieve bills.

Some online services offer to automate the collection of bills, however they require to provide the credentials.
